<h1>MemoryLane</h1>
Families face two main problems when managing their personal and ancestral archives: 1) physical documents risk being irretrivably lost/stolen and irreversibly damaged; and 2) physical indexing can easily become disorganized and inaccessible based on stored location. MemoryLane aims to solve these problems by enabling users to digitize, organize, and contextutalize the documents that characterize their personal and family history
